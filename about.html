	<h1>About Me:</h1>
	<p>
		Hello my name is Abigail. I am taking this course to earn my certificate in Web Development.
		I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2020 at the start of the pandemic and found myself struggling to find an oppurtunity.
		I since decided investing my time in learning more on front end development.
